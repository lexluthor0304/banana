# Gemini Image Editor

The React application lives in the `frontend/` directory.
This repository's root `package.json` simply forwards common scripts
so services like Cloudflare Pages can run the build from the repo root.

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite dev server
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint
- `npm run build` – build the production bundle

Refer to [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) for environment
variables and more detailed development notes.
